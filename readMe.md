### Leaflet

Leaflet is a free, open-source JavaScript library for creating interactive maps. Leaflet  is the library that provides the map interface and functionality. To display a map, you need to use a tile provider.

The tile providers may have their own terms of service and pricing. Many people use OpenStreetMap, which is also a free and open-source option. Other providers like Mapbox or Esri offer free tiers, but may charge for high usage.

### TO DO

- add a Share icon on SpeedCarma
- FlyOut menu with other links
- Make Mobile First if its to be a mobile app
- Upload to GitHub Pages for better versioning
- Activate other Leaflet map features like trails etc. 
- it would be a sub menu configure interface show trails parks etc other Toronto items from their data
